# Capstone Project: Statistics with R Specialization

For this assignment, you will need to imagine that you are a statistical consultant who has recently been hired by a real estate investment firm based in Ames, Iowa. They have had an intern collect and collate all of the recent house sales in Ames and have put together a large spreadsheet that contains the sale price of each house along with many of its physical features. Your employers want you to take this data and develop a model to predict the selling price of a given home.  They hope to use this information to help assess whether the asking price of a house is higher or lower than the true value of the house.  If the home is undervalued, it may be a good investment for the firm.

Your employers are savvy and have been successfully investing in real estate for a long time but they hope a more model-based approach will help focus their search, improving efficiency and the bottom line. The firm plans to use a combination of your model and industry professional expertise to make its investment decisions. Because of this, the firm is not willing to accept a black box solution - they have specified that they must be able to understand the details of your model, including its strengths and its weaknesses. None of the current employees at the firm have any experience or expertise in statistics, statistical inference or modeling - for example you should not assume they will know what a p-value or a linear regression is. As such you will need to explain all of your approaches in layman's terms throughout this project.

## About the Data Analysis Project

It's generally a bad idea to buy the most expensive house in the neighborhood. And remember the real estate agents' mantra: Location, location, location! Keep in mind that the goal is to make money for your investors, and hence investing in a property that is overvalued (costing more than it is worth) is rarely a good idea. This means that it's critical to know which properties are overvalued and which are undervalued. Regression techniques you learned in the prior courses can help you identify them.

Note that if you were actually a consultant for a real-life firm, you would likely need to complete all the phases of a data analysis - the stakeholder analysis, defining the research questions, planning the analysis, implementing the analysis, and creating the summaries and reports to convey your recommendations to the stakeholders. In this course, we will lead you through the analyses step-by-step by asking you to answer specific questions and provide specific visualizations, because we are focusing on determining whether you are able to accurately complete the data analysis functions and that you can draw correct conclusions from the data. This makes the project a realistic subset of a slightly artificial overall framework, in order to help fit it within the scope of the capstone for this specialization.

We will give you three data sets: a subset for training, a subset for testing, and a third subset for validation. You will be asked to do data exploration and build your model (or models) initially using only the training data. Then, you will test your model on the testing data, and finally validate using the validation data. You should not use all of three data sets from the beginning. We are challenging you to keep your analysis experience realistic, and in a realistic scenario you would not have access to all three of these data sets at once. We are giving them all to you at once so you that you can progress through the capstone project at your own pace.

## Overall outline of the assignment

Using the tools and techniques you learned in the specialization, you will build a model to predict housing prices in Ames, and explain how you decided on this model. The assignment consists of five parts:

1. Exploratory data analysis (20 points): must include three correctly labeled graphs and an explanation.

2. Development and assessment of an initial model, following a semi-guided process of analysis (10 points)

    - Initial model: must include a summary table and an explanation/discussion for variable selection

    - Model selection: must include a discussion

    - Residual: must include a residual plot and a discussion

    - RMSE: must include an RMSE and an explanation

    - Model testing: must include an explanation 

3. Development of the final model (20 points)

    - Final model: must include a summary table

    - Variable: must include an explanation

    - Variable interaction: must include an explanation

    - Variable selection: must use appropriate method and include an explanation

4. Assessment of the final model (25 points)

    - Residual: must include a residual plot and a discussion

    - RMSE: must include an RMSE and an explanation

    - Model evaluation: must include an evaluation discussion

    - Model validation: must include a discussion

    - Model result: must include undervalued and overvalued houses

5. Conclusion (10 points): must include a summary of results and a discussion of things learned
